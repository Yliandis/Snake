# Snake

A little Snake with C++ and SFML

------------------

## Dependencies

* C++11 at least
* SFML
* make, if you want to use the project's Makefile

If you are on a linux system, you can install all of these with the following command:

	sudo apt-get install g++ make libsfml-dev

Feel free to adapt the Makefile to your system, your compiler, etc.

Have fun !
